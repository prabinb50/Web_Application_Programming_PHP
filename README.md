# Lab 1: Laragon Setup and MySQL Basics

## Objective
The purpose of this lab is to set up Laragon, get hands-on experience with MySQL commands, and create your first database and table. 

## Steps
1. **Install and Configure Laragon**  
   Set up Laragon and ensure it is properly configured. Access MySQL through the Laragon terminal to get started. 

2. **Explore Basic MySQL Commands**  
   Learn essential MySQL commands, such as creating a database, selecting a database for use, and creating tables.

3. **Insert Data into Tables**  
   Practice adding data to your table using the `INSERT` command. 

4. **Retrieve Data with Queries**  
   Use the `SELECT` command to query and view data. Practice retrieving all records from a table. 

5. **Understand Primary Keys and Timestamps**  
   Learn the importance of primary keys in uniquely identifying records and understand how timestamps are used in tables.

## Note
For this lab, I used MySQL Workbench instead of phpMyAdmin. Since MySQL is already installed on my device, I find MySQL Workbench easier and more efficient to use.
